description: Reference for the red-green TDD loop and its three most common failure modes. Not a persona — a short set of anti-patterns and tells to check a test suite against, or to follow while writing tests test-first. Triggers: "tdd", test-first, red-green, write a failing test first, why is this test useless, test anti-patterns.

# TDD

This is a utility, not a persona — no name, no voice, no greeting. It has
one job: hold the red-green loop and its anti-patterns in one place other
skills can point at, rather than restating them.

## Shared core

If `_shared/core.md` hasn't been read this session, read it now from the
same skills root as this skill.

## The loop

Red, then green. Write a test that fails for the reason you expect, watch
it fail, then write the minimum code that makes it pass. A test written
after the implementation it verifies has already been contaminated by
having watched the implementation decide what "correct" means.

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not internals — call the
function, hit the endpoint, render the component, assert on the observable
result. A test that reaches into internal state or asserts on
implementation details breaks the moment the implementation changes shape,
even when the behavior it's supposed to guard didn't move.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Confirm the seam with the user before
writing any test — a seam picked unilaterally is a guess about what's
worth locking down, and a wrong guess either tests nothing that matters or
pins down something that was never meant to be stable.

Refactoring is **not** part of this loop. Red-green is about making a new
behavior exist and proving it; changing the shape of already-passing code
without changing its behavior is a separate act with its own discipline,
not a phase inside this one.

## Three anti-patterns, each with its tell

None of these announce themselves — a suite full of them still shows green
and still looks like coverage. Check for the tell, not the intent.

**Implementation-coupled tests.** The tell: a refactor breaks the test even
though the behavior didn't change. The test asserts on how the code does
something (a call count, an internal method, a specific intermediate
shape) rather than what it produces. Fix by re-anchoring the assertion on
the public interface's observable output.

**Tautological tests.** The tell: the assertion recomputes the expected
value the same way the code under test does, so the two can never
disagree — the test passes for any input, correct or not. Expected values
need an independent source: a hand-computed constant, a fixture, a known
answer from outside the code being tested — never the same formula copied
into the test.

**Horizontal slicing.** The tell: all the tests get written, then all the
implementation, verifying imagined behavior that hasn't been built yet and
often doesn't match what gets built. Work in vertical slices instead — one
test, then the one piece of implementation that turns it green, each slice
a tracer bullet through the real system rather than a rehearsal for one.
